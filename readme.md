## Bass Bot

This is a simple Discord Bot implemented using JDA.

It currently plays music from all sources that [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer) supports. \
Additionally the [Youtube-Source](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/youtube-source) and [Lavasrc](https://github.com/topi314/LavaSrc)
plugins are installed for streaming YouTube Videos and Spotify songs respectively.

## TODO:
- Add logging
- Add tests
- Add proper exception handling
- Add automatic search for content when using play command
